# **SciCatPlot** 📊✨  
**Automated Plotting and Attachment Tool for Neutron Experiments**

---

## **Overview** 🌟  

**SciCatPlot** is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the visualization and cataloging of neutron experiment data in the **SciCat data catalogue**.  

- 🔍 **Query**: Fetch data files directly from the data catalogue by name or metadata.  
- 📈 **Plot**: Generate high-quality plots from neutron experiment data automatically.  
- 📎 **Attach**: Upload plots as attachments to the corresponding entries in the SciCat data catalogue.  

This tool simplifies experiment documentation and enhances accessibility to visualized data for researchers.

## **Features** 🚀  

- **Automated Plot Creation**: Generates insightful plots from experiment data files with minimal input.  
- **Data Catalogue Integration**: Seamlessly connects to SciCat for querying data files by name or metadata.  
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Automatically uploads generated plots as attachments to the SciCat catalogue, keeping your dataset entries organized and visually informative.
